# Jupyter Tray for Linux

In this project, I provided a tray menu for Jupyter Notebook so that the server daemon looks more 'backended'.

Basically, it is a piece of python code with some settings files.  By using these settings, you can find a icon of Jupyter notebook in your 'Application Launcher', the M$ Windows 'Start Menu'-ish thing on Linux desktop.  Click it and then you can find an icon on system tray.

## Installation

Run the script called `setup.py` and follow the instructions prompt on screen.

## TODO

- [ ] More thoughtful in the setup script.
- [ ] Test it also on Linux distributions other than openSUSE.
- [ ] List a good prerequest package list for the users.
- [ ] ... and others.

You are welcomed to write to the issues part of the repository so that I can improve the code here.
